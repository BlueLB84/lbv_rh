<h1>Homemade Pizza Dough</h1>

<p>Stay in and have a homemade pizza night! The following recipe gives you step-by-step instructions to make your own pizza dough.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Bread Flour - 3/4 cups</li>
	<li>All-purpose Flour - 1/4 cups</li>
	<li>Water (warm - 110 F) - 1 1/2 cups</li>
	<li>Yeast - 2 1/4 tsps</li>
	<li>Olive Oil - 2 Tbsps</li>
	<li>Sugar - 1 tsp</li>
	<li>Salt - 2 tsps</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recipe</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Combine the bread flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, yeast and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine. While the mixer is running, add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil and beat until the dough forms into a ball. If the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a solid ball. If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball.</li>
	<li>Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, add the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm area to let it double in size, about 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Cover each with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rest for 20 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bake on a pizza stone at 425 F for 12-14 minutes or until crust is deep golden brown.</p>
